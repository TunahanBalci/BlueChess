#   HOW TO PLAY?
#
#   Enter a room number to join. If it's unoccupied, you will join a lobby.
#   When your opponent also joins the same lobby, the game will start in 10 seconds.
#       
#   There are 5 time modes: 1 minute, 3 minutes, 5 minutes, 10 minutes, infinite
#
#   If you win a game, your ranking points will increase by
#   10 - (your level / opponent's level / 10)
#
#   If you lose a game, your ranking points will decrease by
#   10 - (opponent's level / your level / 10)
#
#
#   LEVELING UP
#
#   Level = Points / 100 (floor)
#   
#   For example: 
#   548 points -> Level 5
#   299 points -> Level 2
#   700 points -> Level 7
#   
#   
#   BEWARE: This readme file was written in the game's early stages of development.
#           Adressed features might not be implemented or can be changed.
